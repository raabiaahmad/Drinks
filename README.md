# Spring Boot Drinks Project

## Why are we doing this?
We are doing this project to demonstrate our understanding of software development, the topics covered during the course of nine weeks and to give us a completed project to add to our GitHub. It is also useful to see how we’ve been marked and how to progress from this point

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected to have a few bumps especially with testing, but the initial creation of the project I expected to be very simple – which it was. I also wasn’t sure on the documentation side of things and how to use the Jira board as a single person but was quite simple.

I felt very supported by our trainer since the beginning, so I knew if I did run into a major issue that I could ask for help.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Creating the main classes that had the functionality went very well, due to having practiced during the Spring Boot week.

I didn’t realise that we would be setting up tests for all the CRUD functions, so it took some time to work out how to write the code for the unit and integration tests. Therefore, my time management was slightly off and spent quite a bit of time on this. Mostly the tests were fiddly, as I may have left out a bracket or accidentally changed the name of objects. It was overall alright.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Adding more functionality to the app so that it is more useful. Also would probably try to practice using Spring Boot so I don't have to keep referring back to my notes.
